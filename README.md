### Arabic Dialect Text Generation
#### Project Overview
Welcome to the Arabic Dialect Text Generation project, a unique initiative leveraging advanced language models to dynamically create compelling advertisements in various Arabic dialects. This project aims to showcase the power of natural language generation in crafting creative, culturally relevant content for advertising purposes.

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the capability of fine-tuned language models in generating tailored advertisements with a focus on specific Arabic dialects. The fine-tuned model is trained to understand and replicate the linguistic nuances of different dialects, producing engaging and contextually appropriate text.

#### Key Features
Dialect-Specific Advertisements:

The model is designed to generate advertisements in three distinct Arabic dialects: الحجاز (Al-Hijaz), نجدي (Najdi), and مصر (Masr).
Users can input dialect, specifying, to receive advertisements tailored to that linguistic style.
Prompt Engineering:

The project incorporates prompt engineering to guide the model in generating content with specific requirements, such as tone, length, and dialect.
